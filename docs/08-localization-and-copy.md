# Localization and Copy

## Locale files

Supports English, Italian, European Portuguese, Arabic. Translation files in `src/ui/locales/`.

- All UI strings live in flat `*.strings.json` files for all four languages
- Verb translations live in `en.verbs.json`, `it.verbs.json`, `pt.verbs.json` only (verbs need no Arabic translation)
- Root glosses (`roots` key) live in all four: en/it/pt plus `ar.verbs.json`, which has **only** `roots` — Arabic maṣdar/abstract-noun labels, fully vocalised. Wired via `LEXICON_LOADERS` in `useI18n.tsx`
- Add `verbs` + `roots` entries to en/it/pt and the matching `roots` entry to `ar.verbs.json` by hand — no script writes locale entries; `npm run glosses -- --missing` lists what's still untranslated, and `npm run glosses -- <root> [form]` fetches Wiktionary/ElixirFM candidates to translate from (see the `translate-verb` skill)
- Translate primary meaning; add secondary only when diverges significantly (e.g. `"to love, to like"`)
- Include translations in same change as verb entry

## Copy

The rest of this file applies to every string in `src/ui/locales/*.strings.json`. One concept, one name; change all four locales together.

## Examples inside copy

**Use the verb on screen, or use no example.** Explanation strings receive the real forms as params (`{arabic}`, `{pastForm}`, `{presentForm}`, `{prefix}`, `{suffix}`, `{elidedPrefix}`, `{elidedSuffix}`, `{root}`, `{initialRadical}`, `{pattern}`) — reach for those first.

Never illustrate a rule with an unrelated verb (`كُتِبَ` in a string about `نَاوَلَ`), and never invent an inflected pattern form (`يَفْعُو`, `فَعَوْتُ`) to stand in for one. A sentence with no example is better than a sentence with a misleading one.

Pattern names themselves (`فَعَّلَ`, `اِسْتَفْعَل`, `مَفْعُول`, `فُعِلَ`) are standard examples and stay. So do grammatical terms (`اسم الفاعل`, `شَدَّة`), particles (`لَمْ`, `أَنْ`, `سَوْفَ`), bare root letters, and the verb a page is about (`لَيْسَ` on the laysa page, `كَانَ` as its stated analogy).

## Arabic in copy

Every Arabic run, literal or param, is wrapped: `<span lang="ar">…</span>`. `FormattedText` keeps `lang`; without it the browser picks the wrong font and screen readers read Arabic in the UI voice.

Copy is written fully vocalised. `ExplanationText` and `FormInsights` apply the reader's diacritics preference at render, so do not pre-strip marks in the source string.

## One name per concept

| Use | Not |
| --- | --- |
| mīmī | mimi |
| the verb | the stem |
| Form II … Form X, Form Iq … Form IVq | measure, binyan |
| radical (for a root letter) | letter |

A root letter is a **radical** — *first radical*, *middle radical*, *last radical*, *the identical radicals*. Reserve **letter** for something that is not a radical: the Form VIII ت infix, the carrier the hamza sits on, the doubled letter a merge produces, and counting a root's size (*four-letter root*). Italian and Portuguese treat `radicale` / `radical` as feminine, following the `rootInfo.*` strings.

`stem` has no definition anywhere in the copy, so it is not used in it. Say *the verb*, *at the front*, *at the end*.

**Masdar is the one deliberate split.** UI labels stay *Verbal noun* / *Verbal nouns* (`meta.verbalNoun`, `nominalInfo.title.masdar`, `exercise.*.nominal.masdar`); explanation prose says *masdar*, because that is the term the explanation is teaching. Arabic uses `ٱلْمَصْدَرُ` throughout.

Arabic names a radical by its slot in فعل: `ٱلْفَاءُ`, `ٱلْعَيْنُ`, `ٱللَّامُ`, and `ٱلْأُصُولُ` for the set, matching `rootInfo.*`. They are feminine, so agreement follows (`تَصِيرُ ٱلْعَيْنُ ٱلْمُعْتَلَّةُ`, not `يَصِيرُ`). `ٱلْحَرْف` stays for non-radicals: `حَرْفُ ٱلْمُضَارَعَةِ`, `حَرْفٌ مُضَعَّفٌ`, `حَرْفُ عِلَّةٍ` as a category.

Arabic also keeps the wasl distinction the Latin locales make: `أَلِفُ ٱلْوَصْلِ` for the written carrier, `هَمْزَةُ وَصْلٍ` for the elidable hamza.

## Register

Explanation copy is plain: short sentences, hedged with *usually* / *often* where the grammar is a tendency. `formInfo.*.relationship` sits on the same panel as `explanation.form.*` and matches that register. No `animate causer`, `co-participant`, `patient`, `self-causation`.

## Punctuation

- English is **en-US**: `color`, `behavior`, `favorite`, `memorize`.
- Portuguese is **pt_PT, pre-AO90**: `acção`, `activo`, `facto`, `óptimo`, `contacto`, `directo`.
- Apostrophe `’`, never `'`. Ellipsis `…`, never `...`. En dash `–` for ranges (`Forms II–X`); no em dashes.
- Quotes: `“ ”` in English, `« »` in Italian, Portuguese and Arabic.
- Transliterated hamza is `ʾ` (`yāʾ`), never `'`. Long vowels and emphatics carry their marks: `fatḥa`, `ḍamma`, `mīmī`.
- Straight `"` appears only inside markup (`<span lang="ar">`).
